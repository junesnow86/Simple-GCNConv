# Simple GCNConv

## Intro

This is a repo of a simple implementation of GCNConv, in the Deep Learning course in 2023FA.

The experiment requires custom implementation of GCNConv, which is implemented in `src/model.py`. Then we use the custom GCNConv to build GCN models for two tasks: node classification & link prediction.

## How to Use

- Run `node_classification.py` to test the node classification task, and `link_prediction.py` to test the link prediction task.

- Run `main.py` to get the summary.
